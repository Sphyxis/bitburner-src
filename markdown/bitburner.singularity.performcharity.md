This function is used to automatically attempt to perform charitable acts. If you are already in the middle of some ‘working’ action (such as working for a company or training at a gym), then running this function will automatically cancel that action and give you your earnings.

This function returns the number of milliseconds it takes to attempt the specified charity (e.g. It takes 60 seconds to attempt the ‘Stop a Robery’ charity, so running `performCharity('Stop a Robery')` will return 60,000).
