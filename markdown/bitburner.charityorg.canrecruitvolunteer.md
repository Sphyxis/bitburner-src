Once you have successfully created a charityORG by using the function [createCharity](./bitburner.charityorg.createcharity.md)<!-- -->, you can immediately recruit a small number of volunteers. After you have recruited the the first few volunteers, you will require prestige to recruite more. The more volunteers you have, the more prestige you require. If your charityORG has the maximum number of volunteers, this will always return false.
