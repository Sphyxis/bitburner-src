## CharityORG.nextUpdate() method

Sleeps until the next charityORG update has happened.

**Signature:**

```typescript
nextUpdate(): Promise<number>;
```
**Returns:**

Promise&lt;number&gt;

Promise that resolves to the number of milliseconds of charityORG time that were processed in the previous update (200 - 1000 ms).

## Remarks

RAM cost: 1 GB

The amount of real time spent asleep between updates can vary due to "bonus time".

## Example


```js
while (true) {
  const duration = await ns.charityORG.nextUpdate();
  ns.print(`CharityORG completed ${ns.tFormat(duration)} of activity.`);
  ns.print(`Bonus time remaining: ${ns.tFormat(ns.charityORG.getBonusTime())}`);
}
```
